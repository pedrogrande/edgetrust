# User personas and journeys: Trust builder

## User personas

### 1. Alex: The prospective youth member (explorer)
*   **Bio**: Alex is a 19-year-old university student in Melbourne. They are frustrated by traditional education that feels disconnected from the "real world" and want to explore emerging technologies like AI and blockchain without the pressure of grades.
*   **Motivations**: To gain practical skills, build a portfolio of work, and connect with like-minded peers globally. They are driven by a desire for agency and a "civilization-scale upgrade" to the current system.
*   **Goals**:
    *   Earn "Skill Proofs" that are more valuable than a standard degree.
    *   Find a community where their voice and input are valued.
    *   Increase their Trust Score to unlock advanced missions and governance roles.
*   **Pain points**: Overwhelmed by technical jargon; worried about "invisible labor" where their contributions go unrecorded; fears the old system won't value their unique strengths.

### 2. Sarah: The mentor & advisor (steward)
*   **Bio**: Sarah is a 32-year-old digital product designer with a passion for social impact. She has over a decade of experience and wants to give back by guiding the next generation of changemakers.
*   **Motivations**: To empower youth with industry-standard skills and ensure Future's Edge remains an ethical, high-quality sanctuary for learning.
*   **Goals**:
    *   Provide meaningful feedback that helps members grow.
    *   Verify claims efficiently to keep the "mission engine" running.
    *   Identify high-potential members for leadership roles within the DAO.
*   **Pain points**: Limited time for administrative tasks; wants to ensure verification standards are consistent across the community; seeks to mentor without "telling youth what to do."

### 3. Pete: The founding admin (architect)
*   **Bio**: As one of the creators of Future's Edge, Pete is focused on the strategic foundations of the movement. He needs a system that can accurately value work and ensure economic sustainability.
*   **Motivations**: To prove that a youth-led, decentralized model can be profitable and impactful.
*   **Goals**:
    *   Design task contracts that align with strategic pillars (AI, Governance, Impact).
    *   Monitor the "health" of the incentive system to prevent inflation or gaming.
    *   Create a "Genesis" audit trail that can be used for retroactive rewards.
*   **Pain points**: Needs to balance "letting go" (decentralization) with maintaining quality; requires clear data to make informed governance adjustments.

## User journeys

### Journey 1: Joining and the first contribution (The explorer)
1.  **Discovery**: Alex attends the first "Vision, mission & story" webinar and hears about the Trust Builder app.
2.  **Onboarding**: Alex signs up with their email. The system automatically assigns them a Member ID (FE-M-XXXXX) and creates their dashboard.
3.  **Exploration**: Alex browses the public task list. They filter by the "Vision & Story" mission and find a task: "Personal 'Why' Reflection."
4.  **Claiming**: Alex reads the rationale and acceptance criteria. They click "Submit Claim."
5.  **Submission**: Alex writes their 200-word reflection directly into the rich text field and hits "Submit."
6.  **Reward**: The task was set to "Auto-approve." Alex immediately sees their dashboard update with +25 Participation points and a "First Reflection" badge. Their Trust Score increases from 0 to 25.

### Journey 2: Completing a complex task (The builder)
1.  **Challenge**: Having reached 100 Trust Score, Alex sees a complex mission: "Storyverse 2036 Vignette."
2.  **Requirements**: The task has two acceptance criteria: a written story (text) and a visual storyboard (file upload).
3.  **Work**: Alex spends the weekend writing the story and creating a Figma storyboard.
4.  **Submission**: Alex submits two separate proofs for the single task. The system marks the claim as "Pending Review" because it requires a "Mentor Review."
5.  **Feedback**: Sarah (the mentor) receives a notification. She reviews the story and storyboard. She leaves a comment: "Great narrative, but your storyboard needs more focus on the technology used in 2036." She clicks "Request Revision."
6.  **Iteration**: Alex sees the feedback, updates the storyboard, and re-submits.
7.  **Final Approval**: Sarah approves the revised claim. Alex’s dashboard updates with +50 Innovation and +30 Collaboration points.

### Journey 3: Scaling the system (The steward)
1.  **Verification**: Sarah logs in to her steward dashboard. She sees a list of pending claims from different missions.
2.  **Action**: She uses the "Peer Review" workflow to assign a simple verification task to a trusted member (Trust Score > 500) to help clear the backlog.
3.  **Validation**: Sarah reviews a high-value claim for an "AI Agency" mission. She checks the content hash of the submitted file to ensure it hasn't been altered.
4.  **Approval**: She approves the claim. The system automatically awards the member their points and updates the organizational impact dashboard.

### Journey 4: Governance & mission design (The architect)
1.  **Analysis**: Pete reviews the Season 0 analytics. He notices that "Community Building" tasks are being claimed 3x faster than "Governance" tasks.
2.  **Adjustment**: Pete creates a new task: "Governance FAQ Draft." He sets a higher incentive for "Leadership" points to attract more members to this area.
3.  **Publication**: He moves the task from "Draft" to "Open." The event is recorded in the audit trail with a timestamp.
4.  **Recognition**: At the end of the month, Pete exports the "Genesis" audit log. He uses the data to announce the top three "Impact Leaders" during the weekly webinar, publicly recognizing their contributions.
