# Trust builder: Product vision and goals

## Vision statement

Trust Builder is the "living laboratory" for Future’s Edge. It is a task-oriented activity tracking platform designed to prototype the core mechanics of our decentralized future before we move on-chain. By treating every contribution as a "quasi-smart contract," we make the value created by our community legible, verifiable, and rewardable. 

Our vision is to move from traditional, opaque management to a transparent ecosystem where every member—regardless of age or location—has the agency to choose their work, prove their impact, and build a portable reputation they truly own.

## Season 0 strategic goals

The primary purpose of Trust Builder during Season 0 (February – March 2026) is learning and validation, not just technical execution.

1. **Internalize the mental model**: Help founding members and youth leaders move from "doing jobs" to "executing contracts." We want users to understand how task requirements, proof, and rewards intersect.
2. **Validate task valuation**: Test and refine our formulas for determining organizational value. We need to discover which tasks are undervalued, which are over-incentivized, and how to maintain economic sustainability.
3. **Refine proof and verification standards**: Discover what constitutes "sufficient proof" for different types of work. We aim to identify where auto-approval is safe and where peer review adds the most value.
4. **Build a verifiable "genesis" history**: Create an immutable audit trail of all founding contributions. While the prototype is off-chain, the data structure must be robust enough to migrate into on-chain attestations when the full platform launches.
5. **Calibrate the trust score**: Observe how trust points accumulate across different dimensions (Participation, Collaboration, Innovation, Leadership, Impact) to ensure the final reputation system reflects real-world contribution accurately.

## Target audience

*   **Founding members**: Those setting the strategic direction and creating the first missions.
*   **Youth leaders and early adopters**: Prospective members participating in the initial 8-week webinar series.
*   **Mentors and advisors**: Stakeholders who will use the platform to verify work and provide feedback.

## Core principles

*   **Legibility of work**: Every action taken should be clearly linked to a requirement and a result. There should be no "invisible labor" in the organization.
*   **Transparency by default**: All available tasks, their value, the submitted proof, and the resulting rewards are visible to the community.
*   **Human-centered design**: The technology should serve the member experience. Verification should feel like a supportive feedback loop, not an administrative hurdle.
*   **Immutability of terms**: Once a task is published, its core requirements and rewards are fixed. This builds trust that the "rules of the game" won't change while a member is working.
*   **Equity of opportunity**: Access to tasks should be based on skill, interest, and verified trust, not social proximity or traditional credentials.

## Success metrics

### Quantitative
*   **Task completion rate**: The percentage of published tasks that are successfully claimed and verified.
*   **Review velocity**: The average time it takes for a submitted claim to move through verification (especially for peer reviews).
*   **Incentive distribution**: A healthy spread of points across all five dimensions, ensuring we aren't accidentally over-incentivizing one type of behavior.
*   **Member retention**: The number of members who return to complete multiple tasks over the 8-week season.

### Qualitative
*   **Perceived fairness**: Member feedback on whether the rewards matched the effort and if the verification process felt just.
*   **Requirement clarity**: A decrease in clarification requests or rejected claims as we refine how we write acceptance criteria.
*   **Sense of ownership**: Members reporting that their "Trust Score" feels like a meaningful representation of their contribution and growth.

## Out of scope for v1

To maintain focus and speed, the following features are explicitly excluded from the Season 0 prototype:
*   **On-chain wallet integration**: All identity is currently email-based.
*   **Financial payments**: Rewards are points-based (Trust Score) and badges, with a promise of future rewards.
*   **Complex governance voting**: While members may discuss tasks, the formal voting/proposal engine will be a later phase.
*   **Third-party integrations**: The app will be a standalone tool for internal FE use only.
