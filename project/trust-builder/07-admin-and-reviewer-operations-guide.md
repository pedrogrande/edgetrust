# Admin and reviewer operations guide: Trust builder

This guide outlines the day-to-day responsibilities and workflows for the humans managing the Trust Builder platform. Our goal is to maintain a high-trust environment through consistent, empathetic, and transparent operations.

## 1. Roles and responsibilities

### Founding admins (Architects)
*   **Strategic setup**: Defining Missions and creating the initial set of Task contracts.
*   **Incentive design**: Setting point values and weights for tasks to align with organizational goals.
*   **System maintenance**: Managing the "Draft" to "Open" lifecycle and handling task cancellations.
*   **Conflict resolution**: Acting as the final court of appeal for rejected claims or disputes.
*   **Auditing**: Reviewing the Event log for anomalies or gaming behavior.

### Stewards and peer reviewers (Oracles)
*   **Claim verification**: Reviewing member-submitted proof against acceptance criteria.
*   **Constructive feedback**: Providing guidance to members when a claim is "Rejected" or requires "Revision."
*   **Timeliness**: Ensuring claims are processed within the agreed-upon window (e.g., 48–72 hours).
*   **Fairness**: Applying the same standards to all members regardless of personal connections.

## 2. The task creation workflow (Admins)

1.  **Identify the need**: Determine what value a new task will create for the Colony or a specific Mission.
2.  **Create Draft**: Enter the title, rationale (the "Why"), and acceptance criteria (the "What").
3.  **Assign Incentives**: Use the standard point scales to assign Participation, Innovation, etc.
4.  **Define Verification**: Choose between Auto-approve, Admin Review, or Peer Review based on complexity and risk.
5.  **Quality Check**: Ask yourself: "Is it clear what a member needs to submit? Is the reward fair?"
6.  **Publish**: Move the task to the "Open" state. **Reminder**: Once Open, core terms are locked.
7.  **Monitor**: Watch the claim rate. If no one claims it, the incentives may be too low or the criteria too hard.

## 3. The claim review workflow (Reviewers)

1.  **Notification**: You will see a list of "Pending" claims on your dashboard.
2.  **Review Proof**: Open the claim and compare the submitted proof (text/file) against the **Acceptance Criteria**.
3.  **Assessment**:
    *   **Meets all criteria**: Move to **Approved**.
    *   **Minor issues**: Move to **Revision Requested**. Clearly explain what is missing.
    *   **Doesn't meet criteria**: Move to **Rejected**. Provide a clear, respectful rationale.
4.  **Feedback**: Always leave a short comment. For approvals, use "Impact and Gratitude" language (e.g., "Excellent insight on the Storyverse vision, this adds real value to our knowledge bank").
5.  **Completion**: Approval triggers the Trust Score update for the member. Your own points for the review are also recorded.

## 4. Guidelines for "Sufficient Proof"

*   **Verifiable**: Can you see, read, or hear the evidence?
*   **Original**: Does the work appear to be the member's own? Be alert for AI-generated content that hasn't been personalized or reflected upon.
*   **Aligned**: Does the proof actually answer the task's rationale?
*   **Quality vs. Effort**: We value effort and learning over professional-grade polish in Season 0. If a 16-year-old shows genuine insight but poor formatting, focus on the insight.

## 5. Handling disputes and errors

*   **Member appeals**: If a member feels a rejection was unfair, they can request an "Admin Review." A founding admin will make the final decision.
*   **Correcting tasks**: If you discover a critical error in an Open task, **Cancel** it immediately with a public explanation. Create a "v2" of the task and notify anyone who had a pending claim.
*   **Gaming the system**: If you notice a member submitting low-effort or duplicate proof across multiple tasks, flag the Member ID to the founding admins for a "Trust Review."

## 6. Season 0 "Live Lab" ethos

Remember that we are all learning. 
*   **Be flexible**: If a task turns out to be much harder than expected, consider adding a bonus or creating a follow-up task.
*   **Communicate in public**: Use the weekly webinars to highlight great contributions and explain any major changes to the task list.
*   **Empower others**: As soon as a member reaches the 500-point threshold, encourage them to take on Peer Review tasks. This is how we scale collective intelligence.
*   **Lead with empathy**: We are building a "Sanctuary." Every interaction in Trust Builder should feel supportive, even when a claim needs to be rejected.
