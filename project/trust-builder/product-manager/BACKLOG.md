## Sprint 1 Stories (Gherkin)

### Story 1.1: Database Schema & Seed Data

```gherkin
Given the NeonDB project is provisioned
When the fullstack-developer runs the schema migration
Then all tables (groups, members, tasks, criteria, incentives,
     task_incentives, memberships, claims, proofs, events)
     are created with correct types, constraints, and indices
And the "Webinar Series Season 0" mission is seeded
And the "Attend Live Webinar" task is seeded with auto-approve
     and 50 Participation points
And a withTransaction() helper is exported for atomic multi-step operations
And an EventType enum is exported with canonical event type taxonomy
And a logEvent() utility is exported for the append-only event ledger
```

**Ontology**: Groups + Things + Connections + Events (schema + cross-cutting foundations)
**Agent**: `fullstack-developer`
**Points**: 3

---

### Story 1.2: Email Auth & Member Identity

```gherkin
Given a visitor arrives at the Trust Builder
When they sign in with their email
Then a Member record is created (or found) with a permanent
     Member ID (FE-M-XXXXX)
And a secure session cookie is set
And a "member.created" Event is logged (first sign-in only)
```

**Ontology**: People + Events
**Agent**: `fullstack-developer`
**Points**: 5

---

### Story 1.3: Public Task List & Mission Pages

```gherkin
Given the task list page is loaded (no auth required)
When a visitor browses /trust-builder/tasks
Then they see all Open tasks grouped by Mission
And each task shows: title, mission, incentives offered,
     total value, and brief description
And they can filter by mission
```

**Ontology**: Groups + Things (read-only)
**Agent**: `fullstack-developer`
**Points**: 3

---

### Story 1.4: Claim Submission (Rich Text + Auto-Approve)

```gherkin
Given a signed-in Member views an Open task
When they click "Submit Claim" and enter rich text proof
Then a Claim is created with status "Submitted"
And if the task's verification method is "auto-approve",
     the Claim immediately transitions to "Approved"
And the Member's Trust Score is updated atomically
And Events are logged for both "claim.submitted" and
     "claim.approved"
```

**Ontology**: Connections + Events + Knowledge
**Agent**: `fullstack-developer`
**Points**: 5

---

### Story 1.5: Member Dashboard & Trust Score

```gherkin
Given a signed-in Member navigates to /trust-builder/dashboard
When the page loads
Then they see their current Trust Score (derived from Events)
And a breakdown by incentive dimension
     (Participation, Collaboration, Innovation, Leadership, Impact)
And a list of completed tasks with approval status
And a list of pending claims
```

**Ontology**: Knowledge + People
**Agent**: `fullstack-developer`
**Points**: 3

---

### Story 1.6: Append-Only Event Ledger

```gherkin
Given any state transition occurs (member created, task published,
     claim submitted, claim approved, trust score updated)
When the action completes
Then an immutable Event record is written with:
     timestamp (UTC), actor_id, entity_type, entity_id,
     event_type, and metadata (JSONB)
And the Events table has no UPDATE or DELETE permissions
     for the application database user
```

**Note**: `logEvent()` utility is created in S1-01. This story covers the Events API endpoint, export function, verification utilities, and `qa-engineer` immutability testing.

**Ontology**: Events
**Agent**: `fullstack-developer` + `qa-engineer` (immutability test)
**Points**: 3
